# Team challenge objective - Objective: Implement a simple Hashmap using a 10 element array.

Create the classes, Hashmap and Animal (You may want more classes to solve the problem). The Hashmap class will contain the 10 element array for the data.

Create three methods for your Hashmap: Add(key, value) which will add a value to the array, Exists(key) which will return true if the key exists, Get(key) which will return the Animal object for the given key.

Print the structure of your hashmap, for each element which keys does it contain?
